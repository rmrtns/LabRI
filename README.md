# LabRI
LabRI has been developed as a research tool for the exploration of reference intervals in populations consisting of a mixture of distributions. For that, it provides an interactive user interface to several indirect methods for reference interval determination (Bhattacharya, mixtools and refineR analysis). Please review the scientific literature and package documentation of the individual R packages included in this tool for an appreciation of the advantages and disadvantages of the available techniques as well as their correct application. 

The application itself can by accessed via https://rmrtns.shinyapps.io/LabRI/.
